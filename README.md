## What I’m Working On

### ** Business Process Automation (Apps Script + Sheets)**
I build custom internal tools using **Google Apps Script** + **Google Sheets**, including:
- Automated inventory control systems  
- On-edit and cron-based triggers for internal workflows  
- Automated B2B audit data generation for carriers and sales channels  
- Spreadsheet logic turned into fully functional internal “apps”  

### ** Full-Stack Web Development**
Creating scalable applications using:
- **Next.js** (App Router), **React**, **Tailwind**
- **Rails API** backends for structured marketplace platforms
- Modern deployment (CI/CD, Vercel, Google Cloud Build)

Currently developing a **large-scale marketplace platform** (Etsy/eBay style) with logistics-based collaboration between creators, manufacturers, and customers.

### ** Client Websites & Brand Experience**
Through **J3 Digital Marketing**, I design and deploy:
- Responsive, SEO-optimized marketing websites  
- Custom animations, UI/UX, and brand-driven layouts  
- High-performance React/Next.js front-ends

## About Me
I've been into tech since the early home computer days — **Tandy**, **IBM PC**, DOS prompts, and giant CRT monitors.

Those early experiences shaped my love for:
- Problem-solving  
- Building digital tools  
- Learning new technologies  
- Creativity + entrepreneurship  

Now I get to share those passions with my kids — which is pretty awesome.
